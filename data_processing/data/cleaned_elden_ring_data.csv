96,Finger Reader Enia dialog1,"Are you that new Tarnished? You've done well. I am Enia, the Finger Reader. I interpret the words of the Fingers, envoys to the Greater Will. Look there. The Fingers tremble. To welcome you, shardbearer. Let their wisdom wash over you. ""Great Elden Ring, root of the Golden Order."" ""Anchor of all lands, giver of grace, wellspring of all joy."" ""Until it was shattered."" ""The tragic corruption of the Order has taken its toll."" ""Across the realm, life lies in ruin. Fallen to pieces.""",dialog
97,Finger Reader Enia dialog2,"""Foul curses and misery spread, unabating."" ""But the Greater Will has not abandoned the realm, nor the life that inhabits it."" ""So it is that the Tarnished are guided by grace. Called to act."" ""Brave Tarnished, your Great Rune is a handsome shard of the Elden Ring."" ""Seek another of its kind."" ""To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order."" Let the words of the Fingers guide you.",dialog
98,Finger Reader Enia dialog3,"Ahh, Great Runes are the stuff of demigods; the children of the goddess, Queen Marika. She who is vessel of the Elden Ring. Tainted by the strength of their runes, her children warred, but none could become Elden Lord. And so grace was extended, to your kind, the Tarnished. Listen, the Fingers speak. ""The Greater Will has long renounced the demigods."" ""Tarnished, show no mercy. Have their heads. Take all they have left."" ""The Fingers have willed it so."" ...Indeed. But remember one thing. The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika.",dialog

Demigods, and even the greater of the champions, are hewn by the Erdtree upon their end, into remembrances. They are…valuable indeed. These remembrances yet house the power of their former masters. And should you wish to wield that same power, well… I will lend you the strength of the Fingers. Heh… Do not recoil from my offer. The Fingers guide us all. And you Tarnished, you are here to take, are you not?",dialog
101,Finger Reader Enia dialog6,Ah. You have returned. What is it?,dialog

103,Finger Reader Enia dialog8,"I had my doubts, but...my, look at you. Only once before have I seen two Great Runes together. Look there. The Fingers shudder with exuberance. ""Fine work, brave Tarnished. The Greater Will is pleased."" ""You have earned the right to become Elden Lord."" ""Now, seek the Erdtree, and an audience with Queen Marika."" ""To become Elden Lord, and restore the Golden Order."" The Fingers expect... As much from you as they do young Gideon. Take this. A token of farewell.",dialog

The Fingers would never permit it. Nor would the Greater Will. ... ... But here we are...",dialog

123,Ranni the Witch dialog7,"Quite the stubborn one, aren't we? Wise, in a way. The Lands Between are home to liars and cheats aplenty. Perhaps thine ample mistrust will be to thy benefit. I shall leave this for thee, at the behest of Torrent's former master. Take it, shouldst thou overcome thy suspicion. ...",dialog

125,Ranni the Witch dialog9,"Let us speak of the past, a while. I was once an Empyrean. Of the demigods, only I, Miquella, and Malenia could claim that title. Each of us was chosen by our own Two Fingers, as a candidate to succeed Queen Marika, to become the new god of the coming age. But I would not acquiesce to the Two Fingers. I stole the Rune of Death, slew mine own Empyrean flesh, casting it away. I would not be controlled by that thing. The Two Fingers and I have been cursing each other ever since... And the Baleful Shadows...are their assassins.",dialog
126,Ranni the Witch dialog10,"Oh, again we cross paths. I believe I said my name was Renna, when last we met. It pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty... But Tarnished, what business hast thou here? I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.",dialog
127,Ranni the Witch dialog11,"Mm? a Tarnished, here? Thou must have some business in mind, to come all this way. Though I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.",dialog
128,Ranni the Witch dialog12,"I see. Quite the sleuth, aren't we. Indeed, I am the witch Ranni. I stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite. I did it all. But sadly for thee, the cursemark thou seekest is not to be found here. I have slain the body I was born into, and cast it away. And it is upon that flesh the cursemark is carved.",dialog
129,Ranni the Witch dialog13,"Hah! And why should I reveal that to thee? I performed the act not to bury the past, nor in shame of the deed, but all the same, thy begging compels me not a jot. The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say. Now, begone.",dialog
130,Ranni the Witch dialog14,"The cursemark thou seekest is not here. That is all I will say. Now, begone.",dialog
131,Ranni the Witch dialog15,"Oh, is that so? Thou wouldst render me aid, is that thy proposal? Affording thyself opportunity to grope about for the cursemark's location, no doubt? ... Very well... There's nothing wrong with a well-laid scheme. What's more, if my past and past wounds beckon to thee, I am curious enough to see what thy destiny portends... I'll allow it. Enter my service. And good hunting to thee.",dialog
132,Ranni the Witch dialog16,"Hah! No reason in particular, thou claimest? Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this reunion. Intriguing. Then mayhaps fate hath steered thee to this encounter. ... Wilt thou enter into my service? I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path. That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before. Well? Has that roused thy interest?",dialog
133,Ranni the Witch dialog17,I see. A choice well made. Thou'rt a rare sort. Not many would have accepted the offer. But I require as much of those under my command. I anticipate good work from thee.,dialog
134,Ranni the Witch dialog18,"I see. More's the pity. Come to me again, shouldst thou change thy heart. Surrendering thyself into the service of a doll-witch... Is not as frightful as thou fearest...",dialog
135,Ranni the Witch dialog19,"Ah, art thou persuaded to my cause? Then, again I shall ask, wilt thou enter into my service?",dialog
136,Ranni the Witch dialog20,"Good, then I ask we proceed with haste. There is, in my service, a half-wolven warrior by the name of Blaidd. I would have thee join him in searching for the hidden treasure of Nokron, the Eternal City. I have called for Blaidd to greet thee below. Take from him the particulars. Ah, and there wilt thou find Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, also. Heed not their peculiarities; feel secure in gaining from them what advantage thou canst. I am sure the others will be doing just the same.",dialog
137,Ranni the Witch dialog21,"Speak with the three who await thee below. Thou needst not indulge them unduly, but they too wish to appraise thy worth. It hath been a passing long time since a newcomer entered my service, after all.",dialog
138,Ranni the Witch dialog22,"Good, then I ask we proceed with haste. Art thou aware of the star that struck Limgrave? It left a vast crater, and through it lieth the Eternal City of Nokron. Go there to find the city's hidden treasure.",dialog
139,Ranni the Witch dialog23,"Ah, yes. Iji, my war counselor, and Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts, can be found below. Like thee, they are in my service.

145,Ranni the Witch dialog29,"Ah, but before I leave, I must entrust thee with this. Take it. My discarded flesh lieth beyond the seal unlocked by it. Upon which is carved the cursemark of thy desire. I can fathom what thy purpose might be. Neither of us is welcomed by the brighter path, I see. You may leave now. It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.",dialog

A strange gift, perhaps, but a rare sort such as thee would welcome it, I am sure. I am certain now, fate steered us to our reunion. I am certain now, fate steered us to our first encounter. I must thank Torrent too, for his part. You may leave now. It was but brief, but thou gavest me fine service.",dialog

Mine will be an order not of gold, but the stars and moon of the chill night. I would keep them far from the earth beneath our feet. As it is now, life, and souls, and order are bound tightly together, but I would have them at a great remove. And have the certainties of sight, emotion, faith, and touch...

520,Smithing Master Iji dialog5,"Brave Tarnished. A word of warning, if you please. This territory once belonged to the Carian royal family. Their manor lies not far beyond this point. When the Raya Lucaria Academy turned on the Carians, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract. After leveling it, they carried on to the manor. The Carians were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the knights' onslaught... By conjuring an enchanted snare that remains potent to this day. That is why I say, Tarnished. Don't go near the manor. Unless you wish to lie with the corpses of the heedless Knights of the Cuckoo.",dialog

After years of expeditions, we've determined the location of Nokron. By going underground through the well in the Mistwood of Limgrave, you can see Nokron up above.

Of the true ruler of this manor, Lord Rykard. The Erdtree blessed the Tarnished with grace. But it was all too meagre, in the face of the enormity of their task. The Tarnished were forced to scavenge, squabbling for crumbs. Like the shardbearers, vying for power in the wake of the Shattering. Our Lord, indignant, has refused. To scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us. If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so,",dialog

You may also behold its golden rays pointing in a particular direction at times. That is the guidance of grace. The path that a Tarnished must travel. It's nothing short of a miracle.

And off you trotted to the Roundtable Hold… My sincerest congratulations. But, how did you find the Roundtable? Oh, you don't have to say it. Before, the Roundtable was chock full of venerated warriors, but now, it's home to puff-chests and has-beens. I fear you've been terribly disappointed. I don't blame you. But still, the Roundtable has its perks. Why not earn a seat? Fly straight and true, so to speak.",dialog

692,White Mask Varré dialog12,"... Yes, I see. Perhaps it's just as well. Besides, you are maidenless. One can only do so much with the materials provided. But then again, if you should realise the error of your ways, I'm always willing to hear you out.",dialog

698,White Mask Varré dialog18,"Ah-ha, your intuition serves you well. My doubts had been piling up, you see. ...The words of the Two Fingers cannot be trusted. Truly, naught but rambling, senile delusions. I believe, that when the Elden Ring was shattered, the Two Fingers were corrupted, their guidance; skewed. Even worse, the Fingers harbor no love for our kind. That's the part that irks the most.",dialog
699,White Mask Varré dialog19,"Oh, I have a gift for you, something fit only for the wise.",dialog

702,White Mask Varré dialog22,Oh? Is something wrong?,dialog
703,White Mask Varré dialog23,"Be sure to try that finger I gave you. There's no reason to dither. The Tarnished were spurned by grace, forsaken by the Two Fingers. And now they ask you to mend their crumbling world? Hah, your loyalties are misplaced with them.",dialog

705,White Mask Varré dialog25,"Oh, lambkin, so pleased you're here. I'm glad that you're enjoying my gift. Mmm, I knew it from the very start. You have a taste for noble blood. ... I wish to anoint you a proper inductee. A knight to serve Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, and establish a new dynasty. Luminary Mohg has strength, vision, and of course, love. So, what do you say, my lambkin?",dialog
706,White Mask Varré dialog26,"Mm, yes, who would have it any other way? Now, take this. For your final trial. Soak the cloth with a maiden's blood. Normally, this ritual would involve killing one's own maiden, and recanting the wisdom of the Two Fingers. But since you are maidenless, the blood of anyone's maiden will do.",dialog

A knight who will assist Luminary Mohg, the Lord of Blood, in the establishment of a new dynasty. Now, give me your finger. This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor, once it settles. Inside of you. Oh, good heavens. Clench your teeth, or something. Never forget that feeling of agony. For it is what binds you, to Luminary Mohg. To all of us. Ha ha ha...",dialog

776,Guilbert the Redeemer (cut npc) dialog11,"Alright, then. I'm off to Stormveil Castle. Lord Godrick has kept busy with his grafting... Slicing off arms like harvesting ears of wheat. He's run up a mighty debt in blood. A demigod, yes, he may be... But no one escapes a Redeemer.",dialog

794,Preceptor Seluvis dialog1,"I see... You must be Ranni's new hireling. I see... You must be Ranni's new girl. Yes, yes, I've heard all about you. I am Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts. I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial Tarnished like you, but since we have the misfortune of serving the same Lady, I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you.",dialog
795,Preceptor Seluvis dialog2,"I reside...in another tower, close by. Come and pay me a visit... Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Ranni. If it were up to me, I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you. But who am I to stand against the wishes of my Lady?",dialog
796,Preceptor Seluvis dialog3,"Well, well. You took me at my word. Did you not realise I was merely being polite? You provincials never cease to amaze... Hmm, I suppose you're here now. Perhaps I'll give you something to do. I'd like you to find a woman called Nepheli, to administer a potion. Even you can do that much, can't you?",dialog
797,Preceptor Seluvis dialog4,"Good, good. Now I shall hand over the potion in question. Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it. I expect glad tidings. And soon.",dialog
798,Preceptor Seluvis dialog5,"I see... What a wretched bunch you Tarnished are. Do you understand? I've given you a very fine chance. If you complete this simple task, I will graciously permit you to learn from me. Even you wish to serve our Lady well, do you not? Turn those little cogs upstairs, and return with the correct answer.",dialog
799,Preceptor Seluvis dialog6,Have you fumbled out the correct answer now? Then you will undertake my task?,dialog
800,Preceptor Seluvis dialog7,... You are peerless in your dullardry. Fine. I can feel my wits evaporating in your mere presence. Don't bother wasting your breath on me again.,dialog
801,Preceptor Seluvis dialog8,"I could have sworn I told you to trouble me no more... Are you here to tender your sincere apology, and undertake my task?",dialog
802,Preceptor Seluvis dialog9,"Good, good. As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology. Now I shall hand over the potion in question. Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it. I expect glad tidings. And soon.",dialog
803,Preceptor Seluvis dialog10,I've no time for idle chit chat. The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your task's completion. Are we understood? Then off you trot. I have enough on my plate.,dialog
804,Preceptor Seluvis dialog11,"Ahh, so you made Nepheli drink the potion? Well done. You are a touch more useful than I had thought. Well done. You are a slight more useful than I had thought. Very well. Then you shall have your gift. Knowledge of the sorcerous arts, under the tutelage of the great Preceptor Seluvis. I doubt much of it will lay within the grasp of a mere Tarnished, but... If you put your mind to it, perhaps you won't embarrass our Lady.",dialog
805,Preceptor Seluvis dialog12,"You wish to begin right this moment? Well, your impatience, though boorish, is understandable. Let's have at it.",dialog
806,Preceptor Seluvis dialog13,Begging for another lesson so soon? There remains much to be done. Make it quick.,dialog
807,Preceptor Seluvis dialog14,"Come now, the pretence of comprehension becomes you not. Bend over backwards any further and you're apt to break.",dialog
808,Preceptor Seluvis dialog15,"Well, well. You're asking me about that, are you? The task was left to you and the mongrel, was it not? Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot. Well...there's no helping it. Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it. There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave. She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy. I asked her to look into the matter some time ago. I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her.",dialog
809,Preceptor Seluvis dialog16,"So, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly? Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it. It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe. I may have expected too much of her, to begin with.",dialog
810,Preceptor Seluvis dialog17,"You break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please? Your oafishness knows no bounds. Fine and well. You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion. I believe that makes you my accomplice. You yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm? Well, normally one of your stature would never be allowed. But perhaps I can make a very special exception. Now, choose.",dialog
811,Preceptor Seluvis dialog18,"Ah, I knew you'd see things my way. You knew you were already my accomplice, and as such... You wanted one for yourself, hmm? A puppet, to cherish. Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are. Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are. Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road. To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire. Now, choose.",dialog
812,Preceptor Seluvis dialog19,"Well, this is a surprise. But aren't we forgetting something? The tipple you fooled Nepheli into drinking, yes, my little draught. You are already my accomplice. Are you ready to change your mind, now? It's no sin, pining for a puppet to cherish.",dialog
813,Preceptor Seluvis dialog20,"Now, hand it over, and don't make a fuss. Nothing bad will happen. I'll even consider giving you a puppet of your own.",dialog
814,Preceptor Seluvis dialog21,"(huge sigh) You truly are beyond salvation. Fine. Leave this place, and never darken my doorstep again. Ah, what a terrible pity. This is the last time I'll see you, in your present state.",dialog
815,Preceptor Seluvis dialog22,"I thought I told you never to show your face again. Have you decided to return what's mine, and proffer a sincere apology?",dialog
816,Preceptor Seluvis dialog23,"Good, good. As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology. And well, you finally realised, did you? All you really wanted was a puppet to cherish. To fill that hole deep in your heart. Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are. Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are. Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road. To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire. Now, choose.",dialog
817,Preceptor Seluvis dialog24,"How's the puppet I gave you? A thing of exquisite craft, is it not?",dialog
818,Preceptor Seluvis dialog25,"What's that? You want another puppet? Quite the keen paramour, aren't we. Well, aren't you a woman of many passions. But, I'm afraid each and every one is like a child to me. I can hardly just give them away. Oh dear, what's to be done? Why don't you...fetch me some starlight shards? It's no mere booze, but a refined old drink of amber hue. If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you. The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few. And once each's predilections are known to you, the better you'll be able to love them.",dialog
819,Preceptor Seluvis dialog26,"Oh yes, you have much to look forward to, further down this road.",dialog
820,Preceptor Seluvis dialog27,You're proving to be quite the puppeteer. I've not had an apprentice for…a very long time indeed.,dialog
821,Preceptor Seluvis dialog28,"Perhaps, you'd be interested in a little scheme of mine? It will produce the finest of puppets. Which I aspire to cherish with these very hands. A ploy to fool even Lady Ranni... How does that sound?",dialog
822,Preceptor Seluvis dialog29,"Ahh, I knew I had you pegged. Heh. I knew I had you pegged. You're just like me. Then I'd like you to procure something. A rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber. With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness. And even a demigod would be slave to its charms... Procure it for me. The rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber. With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness. And even a demigod would be slave to its charms...",dialog
823,Preceptor Seluvis dialog30,"Very good. A wise choice, indeed. You passed my little test with flying colours. I was merely gauging your loyalty to Lady Ranni. Well done, I'm very proud of you. Let's both do our utmost in service of our Lady.",dialog
824,Preceptor Seluvis dialog31,Ah ha. Might you be interested after all? In a fine scheme to sport with Lady Ranni?,dialog
825,Preceptor Seluvis dialog32,"Alright, enough of these games. Your test is well and truly over. Wag your tail for master all you like, but your loyalty is merely blind. I fear your wretched provinciality is apt to burst. You're oozing at the seams.",dialog
826,Preceptor Seluvis dialog33,"Well, well, you managed to lay your hands on it! The blessed day is finally upon us... Goodness gracious, the way it glistens...utterly enchanting. To think, this was once a demigod's very fate... My oh my oh my...",dialog
827,Preceptor Seluvis dialog34,"Ah, are you still here? Oh yes, I should give you your reward. Please, it's all yours. Splendid work. Just marvellous. Now, just you wait. The merriment is soon to begin. The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...",dialog
828,Preceptor Seluvis dialog35,"Good, I've been waiting for you. It's finally complete. The perfection of my draught, gleaming nectar-sweet. Give it to Ranni and ensure she drinks it. The dead-eyed doll lets down her guard in your presence, rather remarkably. Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona…she's a frail, gentle girl at heart. Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona...she's still just a feeble, pampered little girl when it comes down to it. Which is why you're the only one for the job. Now do it. Make Ranni drink my draught.",dialog
829,Preceptor Seluvis dialog36,"You...understand, don't you? That once you have Ranni drink my draught, my scheme will come to fruition. And we, well, we'll be in a position to claim the very finest puppet ever crafted. Just imagine...the pure elation...",dialog
830,Preceptor Seluvis dialog37,"Come now, don't make me wait. I can barely contain myself as it is...",dialog
831,Preceptor Seluvis dialog38,"You'll be flabbergasted, I can assure you. The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly...",dialog
832,Preceptor Seluvis dialog39,"Hmm. Is that a scroll? I won't bother to ask where you pilfered it, but... You're correct to assume I'm one of the few who can decipher it. So, I'm perfectly happy to take it off your hands. That said, don't you dare get your hopes up. More often than not, new knowledge is merely an opportunity to reflect… …upon the mediocrity of one's intellect.",dialog
833,Preceptor Seluvis dialog40,"Oh, perhaps you've already noticed. The nightly wolf howling that's been disturbing the peace here. If that bothersome mutt, Blaidd, is back in town, then tell him to pack up and ship out. I never liked the din of a dog's howl. From a mongrel like him, it's simply agony.",dialog
834,Preceptor Seluvis dialog41,"Well, what have we here? Are you proposing that I partake? Do I appear such a gormless tomfool to you? A slow-wit who'd divulge his secrets for a moment of bliss? Well, let me give you some advice. Scheming has its place, but consider the one you're scheming against. You might find yourself on the wrong end of a proper beating one day.",dialog
835,Preceptor Seluvis dialog42,"O-oh! Y-you! I, er, sorry, your worship... Y-you! I, er, sorry, madam... I-I apologise for any offence given. I am Pidia. Servant to the Carian royal family. I am charged with maintaining these g-ghastly dolls.",dialog
836,Preceptor Seluvis dialog43,"Ahh, your worship, allow me to be of use. Ahh, kind madam, allow me to be of use. Other than the puppets, there are some very fine things up here in this storeroom. Why not pick something out, before you go? But please, can you offer poor ill-starred Pidia... A little something by way of compensation?",dialog
837,Preceptor Seluvis dialog44,"Ah, a fine day to your worship. Ah, kind madam, a fine day to y-you. Please, choose whatever you like.",dialog
838,Preceptor Seluvis dialog45,"Ah, I'm sorry your worship, but poor Pidia has given all he has. Ah, I'm sorry kind madam, but poor Pidia has given all he has. I can't be of further use to you. Please, forgive me.",dialog
839,Preceptor Seluvis dialog46,"Please, find it in your heart... Forgive me...",dialog
840,Preceptor Seluvis dialog47,"Argh! Arrgh! S-stop, please, stop! Y-you're my puppets! I loved you with all I have! How could you forget...such bliss? Ouch! That hurts! Please, I beg you, cease this cruelty! Eeek Eeeeeeek!",dialog
841,Preceptor Seluvis dialog48,"Oh, that's very kind. Poor Pidia could never accept such a precious brew. Very sorry, really, if I... I've disappointed you, If you will, please forget this matter entirely.",dialog
842,Preceptor Seluvis dialog49,Agh!,dialog
843,Preceptor Seluvis dialog50,"Enough of that, now. Have you forgotten that we both serve the same Lady?",dialog

852,Patches dialog6,"Ahhh... Well, what do you know? You're Tarnished, like me. Now, how did I get that wrong? I took you for a demi-human, or some such. An innocent mistake, I assure you. Well, water under the bridge. Now we're squared up, how about we play nice from now on?",dialog

857,Patches dialog11,"Well, nice of you to drop in, finally. It's all a bit ad hoc, but I'm sure you'll find something. And welcome to Patches' Emporium. Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything's top notch.",dialog
858,Patches dialog12,"Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium.",dialog
859,Patches dialog13,Cheers for that.,dialog
860,Patches dialog14,"Stingy little beggar... Try to find it in your heart next time, eh?",dialog
861,Patches dialog15,"Yeah, I had those bandits make a clean break. Now they're all suppliers, and good ones at that. I mean, they don't understand a word I'm saying, but it hardly matters, we have a natural connection. They're all foot soldiers. Survivors of a defeated army. Worked to the bone by their high-and-mighty lord, only to be thrown out with the rubbish. ...It's the same old story, everywhere I go. Ah, to hell with it all.",dialog
862,Patches dialog16,"Hm? Wondering what's inside the treasure chest? Well, it's uh, nothing too special. Just something I'm saving as thanks, for a very valuable customer... But then again, it would fetch some spectacular coin... And besides, this valuable customer could be a long time coming... Eh? Everything is give and take, give and take.",dialog
863,Patches dialog17,"Forgot something on your shopping list? No, no trouble to me.",dialog
864,Patches dialog18,"By the way, friend... You've really been there for me, through thick and thin. And so, I've made up my mind. I bequeath that chest to you. An extra-special thanks, for an extra-special customer.",dialog
865,Patches dialog19,"What's wrong? I've made up my mind. The treasure chest is yours, in word and deed. Sure, it may be worth its weight in gold. But a Patches Promise? Well, that's priceless!",dialog
866,Patches dialog20,"Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive. You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that. Maybe it's a sign to keep your mitts off what's not rightly yours, hmm? But I'll forgive you. View it as a learning experience. At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe. And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!",dialog
867,Patches dialog21,"Ah, oh... How in blazes... You're alive. You had me proper scared. Poofing away in a flash like that. Who on earth spends their time booby-trapping treasure chests? No way I could've known, but still, I apologise. It's all very unfortunate. At any rate, it's nice just to see you safe. And don't miss all the bargains, here at Patches' Emporium!",dialog
868,Patches dialog22,"Oh yes, by the way. I'm saying goodbye to the old cave. I'm untethered, by nature, and It's about time that I moved on. No worries, the old gang will inherit the shop. They may not speak a word, but they never forget a face. Spare them some coin after I'm gone, eh?",dialog
869,Patches dialog23,"Oh, well! It's been a long while. It's me. Patches the Untethered. I'm still in business, if you can believe it. Now I'm my only supplier, so I haven't got much, but everything here is top notch. Patches' Emporium, now open in Raya Lucaria.",dialog
870,Patches dialog24,"You have yourself a discerning eye, I can tell. That statuette will net you a small fortune, no doubt. In fact, I'll bet any of those scruffy merchants would leap at the chance to buy it... (laughs)",dialog
871,Patches dialog25,"Oh, really? No interest in the statuette? I was sure it would catch your eye. Well, I can't force it on you, but... Incomparable craftsmanship, you know. I'd hate to see it go to someone else...",dialog
872,Patches dialog26,"By the way, have you met that girl Rya? I spotted her somewhere along the highroad not long ago. She's a strange one, but I believe she was in need of help. Not that it's any of my business, but... If she rings your bell, why not lend her an ear?",dialog
873,Patches dialog27,"Looking for Rya? Still hanging around on the high road, I suppose.",dialog
874,Patches dialog28,"Oh, hello. I knew it'd all be fine... Oh, it's nothing, don't mind me. Welcome to Patches' Emporium!",dialog
875,Patches dialog29,"You're...making your way to the Erdtree, no? Well I heard something that might help. A special means of reaching your destination. Have you ever seen an iron virgin? The clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels. ...but long ago, they were endowed with a spell of transposition. And get this. A surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Its transpositional powers fully intact. So, right, if you get caught in it on purpose... It'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree... Or so I'm told... Ha ha...ha ha...",dialog
876,Patches dialog30,"Oh yeah, great story isn't it. I'll tell you as many times as you like. There's a surviving Iron Virgin at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria. And I heard...if you let yourself get caught in it, it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree. Heh heh...ha ha...",dialog
877,Patches dialog31,"Well, fancy meeting you here. Hold on, don't you say a word, my friend. I spoke no lie, not a one. You were trapped inside a volcano, no mistake, but the Erdtree was right outside. You just had to spring yourself out. I'm willing to admit. I could have been more clear. But I did not lie, and you're perfectly unscathed. All's well that ends well, right?",dialog
878,Patches dialog32,"Oh, erm, hello, yes. Strange place for a chance encounter, eh? Thought I could use a rest. Don't mind me, go about your business. Right, over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear. Heh heh heh...",dialog
879,Patches dialog33,"What is it? Oh, don't mind me. Off you trot. Right over there, see that? Something's shimmering, I swear. Heh heh heh...",dialog
880,Patches dialog34,"Oh, my, well, here you are again. So sorry for that. I meant to warn you, but whoops! There you went. Despite my best intentions, I've done you wrong, I have. But here you are, standing tall and proud. All's well that ends well, eh. And my warning was spot-on, you tell me different! Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion. I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals. Mm...heh heh...",dialog
881,Patches dialog35,"You didn't listen last time, but I'm warning you again. Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion. I heard the brutes there hunt Tarnished like animals. Heh heh...heh heh...",dialog
882,Patches dialog36,"Well, you've joined the Manor, eh? I don't believe it. Didn't think you had it in you. And here I thought Rya was barking up the wrong tree... All good, though. We're on the same side, now. We'll do good work together.",dialog
883,Patches dialog37,"Oh, and of course, we can do business, if you like. Patches' Emporium at the Volcano Manor. Specially for you.",dialog
884,Patches dialog38,"Ahh, hello, what impeccable timing. This is for you.",dialog
885,Patches dialog39,"You're new here at the Manor. But if you complete the request, you can improve your standing. Relax, we're old friends. Time's come to pass the torch, right? Go on, break a leg, then. Heh heh...",dialog
886,Patches dialog40,"What's the matter? Having trouble nabbing your prey? Well, I wouldn't go asking for help so soon. We're not here to make your life easier. Do you remember your vow to Tanith? To rise against the Erdtree. Dare I say your heart was never in it to begin with?",dialog
887,Patches dialog41,You and Diallos both. Perhaps your hearts were never in it to begin with?,dialog
888,Patches dialog42,"You hunted down Tragoth? Are you certain? No, it's quite alright, fine work, indeed. I'll give Tanith the news. Have some rest, by all means.",dialog
889,Patches dialog43,"Are you surprised? That I belong to the Volcano Manor. I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable Two Fingers. I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade. Not to mention Tanith has always made me curious. I guess her master must really be something, cause she's pretty damn smug about it. Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions, she still stands proud. I've never seen a woman quite like her...",dialog
890,Patches dialog44,"Hmph. Sharper than you seem, aren't you... I was just holding onto it for you, you know. Here you go. The reward for hunting Tragoth. All yours.",dialog
891,Patches dialog45,"Now you've gone and killed Rykard? You scheming little bastard. You scheming little doxie. Cripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical... Perhaps a Tarnished will be Elden Lord after all... But for now, this Manor is finished. The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head. A fine mess, but how else could it end when daddy ambition is head over heels courting lady blasphemy. Heh heh...ha ha... Well, here I am. Untethered, once again. Good-bye, my friend.",dialog
892,Patches dialog46,"What is it? Oh, come to make a parting donation to Patches' Emporium?",dialog
893,Patches dialog47,"Ah, oh, you again... A shame you had to see me like this... Ohh, I had a bit of a slip-up, that's all. I should have stuck to what I know best... No matter. I know I-I can trust you. Gullible, yes, but a good soul. Make certain that Tanith gets this. Oh, it's nothing, it's just... Makes me sick to see her all bent out of shape. C'mon, Tanith, back on your high horse, where you belong.",dialog

895,Patches dialog49,"Well, well, well? Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings? You scheming little thief. The gods demand repentance! Cough up your coin, all of it!",dialog
896,Patches dialog50,"Hm? Wait, don't tell me, is that you? Oh, cripes, please, wait! I surrender! I surrender, I swear!",dialog
897,Patches dialog51,"Do you even hear me? I said ""surrender"", loud and clear! No one likes a bull-headed brute! You'd clobber your old mate, then, would you?",dialog
898,Patches dialog52,"Cripes! Are you dense, mate? What in the world has gotten into you! Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming. Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!",dialog
899,Patches dialog53,"Well, glad to see we're on the same page. I'd never cross you, not even close. He he he...",dialog
900,Patches dialog54,"Ahhh... It's been ages since I've seen you. I didn't even realise it was you. Took you for a demi-human, or some such. You know how it is, just an innocent mistake. Water under the bridge, eh, back to business as usual?",dialog
901,Patches dialog55,Hell's bells... This bandit business is hardly what it's cracked up to be... Especially if we keep running into the likes of you... ...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...,dialog
902,Patches dialog56,...Maybe I'll set up another shop with the lads...,dialog
903,Patches dialog57,"Well, finally made it, eh, and just in time. For the grand reopening of Patches' Emporium. Where you won't need a refund, 'cause everything is top notch!",dialog
904,Patches dialog58,"Hello, again. Welcome to Patches' Emporium.",dialog
905,Patches dialog59,Cheers for that.,dialog
906,Patches dialog60,"What, do I have to beg? Give us a coin or two next time around, will you?",dialog
907,Patches dialog61,Forgot something on your shopping list? No trouble to me.,dialog
908,Patches dialog62,"Booze, eh? Good stuff, by the look of it. But, er, I'm alright, thanks. As my dear nan used to say, ""there's no such thing as a free lunch""...",dialog
909,Patches dialog63,...,dialog
910,Patches dialog64,Ngh!,dialog
911,Patches dialog65,What are you playing at? That bloody well hurts!,dialog
912,Patches dialog66,"What's wrong with you? It's me, Patches. Patches! Enough now, stop!",dialog
913,Patches dialog67,"Ugh. Hard of hearing, are we?",dialog
914,Patches dialog68,"Fine, have it your way. You'll get what's coming! Don't go thinking I'm a soft touch!",dialog
915,Patches dialog69,"Last chance to surrender, mate. Grovel...and I'll forgive you.",dialog
916,Patches dialog70,Well... It was bound to happen some day... What a shit show...,dialog
917,Patches dialog71,"Try not to be so slow on the uptake, eh.",dialog
918,Patches dialog72,"There's a special circle, for rotten thieves like you.",dialog
919,Patches dialog73,"Well, it looks like you've seen the error of your ways. ... Water under the bridge. Am I wrong? We'll call it a momentary lapse of judgment. ""All's well"", as you know. So, what can I do you for today?",dialog
920,Patches dialog74,"Okay, I can see you mean it. Consider it water under the bridge. A momentary lapse of judgment. ""All's well"", as you know.",dialog
921,Patches dialog75,So. Do you need something from me?,dialog
922,Patches dialog76,,dialog
923,Merchant Kalé dialog1,"You're a Tarnished, I can see it. And I can also see... That you're not after my throat. Then why not purchase a little something? I am Kalé. Purveyor of fine goods.",dialog
924,Merchant Kalé dialog2,What is it? Still going to purchase something?,dialog
925,Merchant Kalé dialog3,"Wait, weren't you...? Well, you're back. Care to buy something?",dialog
926,Merchant Kalé dialog4,"Ah, it's you again. Always a pleasure. Care to purchase anything?",dialog
927,Merchant Kalé dialog5,Good-bye for now.,dialog
928,Merchant Kalé dialog6,Good-bye. Nice to do business.,dialog
929,Merchant Kalé dialog7,I am of a nomadic people. Selling wares as I travel. The land has been tainted by madness since the shattering of the Elden Ring. It's only Tarnished like yourself who keep things from drying up entirely. Let's say you're a very welcome customer.,dialog
930,Merchant Kalé dialog8,"You know, if you can spare the runes, you should buy yourself a crafting kit. A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own. Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration. The kit costs a bundle, and I admit, I do take my cut. But the important thing is that you survive. Every customer counts, after all.",dialog
931,Merchant Kalé dialog9,I'm glad you took my warning to heart. You've made an excellent choice.,dialog
932,Merchant Kalé dialog10,"There are others of my people who yet survive in these lands. If the mood takes you when you meet one, then offer them some trade, won't you? My people, wanderers all, have long been spurned by the grace of gold. Which is why we cannot settle, but instead are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey. But thanks to that, things are not so different for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered. I think this makes us kindred spirits of sorts. Your people, the Tarnished, and mine.",dialog
933,Merchant Kalé dialog11,"I suppose I shouldn't keep this from you.  I'm thinking of moving elsewhere for a time. My people are wanderers all, which I won't deny is one reason... But I've done all I can here, in search of the Great Caravan.",dialog
934,Merchant Kalé dialog12,"Perhaps you don't need to hear this, but... See that no harm comes to my kin. We have a saying, we wanderers. Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy. No regard. Nothing. But if anyone dares harm us, show them no mercy. That is our code, so to speak. Just the way we are. Deeply... unforgiving.",dialog
935,Merchant Kalé dialog13,"Ah, by the way... Have you heard of the Great Caravan?",dialog
936,Merchant Kalé dialog14,"...I see, more's the pity. Well, even we had a place to call home, once.",dialog
937,Merchant Kalé dialog15,"The howl of a wolf, in the Mistwood... I suppose he must still be skulking about... Mmm, I know. Why not meet him for yourself? Next time you hear the wolf's howl, make this signal right under the source. Oh, don't fret, there is nothing to fear. I just have an inkling the two of you might hit it off.",dialog
938,Merchant Kalé dialog16,"Oh, by the way. There's someone you should meet. If you happen to hear a wolf's howl, make this signal under the source.",dialog
939,Merchant Kalé dialog17,"Oh, then you met Blaidd, did you? Wonderful. I'm glad I pointed you in his direction. He's boorish, blunt, and couldn't find his nose with both hands, but he's a good egg. I think the two of you are sure to find the best in one another.",dialog
940,Merchant Kalé dialog18,"Ah, good to see you. I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble. Thought I'd set up shop here for a time. A pleasure, as ever. Care to purchase anything?",dialog
941,Merchant Kalé dialog19,"We meet again, I see. It's me, Kalé. Thought I'd set up shop here for a time. Right then. Care to purchase anything?",dialog
942,Merchant Kalé dialog20,"Have you seen a crow around here by any chance? You know, a burial crow, with a letter fastened to its claw? Well, if you do set eyes upon it, I'll buy that letter from you, no question. I'd give you a generous sum for it, of course.",dialog
943,Merchant Kalé dialog21,"My thanks. I've been wanting to get my hands on this. And I was willing to pay whatever was needed. Your reward, as promised.",dialog
944,Merchant Kalé dialog22,"So, about the letter you brought me... It's just as I suspected, it features a cryptogram of my people. And I'm sure it's come from wherever the Great Caravan disappeared to. This could be my chance to get close to it. Thanks to you.",dialog
945,Merchant Kalé dialog23,"Once I decipher that cryptogram, I'll be packing up shop again. Don't worry, I'll leave a sign that shows where I've gone. With any luck, I'll see you there, eh.",dialog
946,Merchant Kalé dialog24,"I've always preferred my own company, to that of other people's... And I don't have any burning questions I wish to ask my ancestors... But there's something I need to know. My roots. I want to know who I am. Where I came from. Where I'm headed.",dialog
947,Merchant Kalé dialog25,"Ah, good to see you. I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble. The shop is all set up. A pleasure as ever. Care to purchase anything?",dialog
948,Merchant Kalé dialog26,"Oh yes, about the cryptogram from the letter... I think it's pointing underneath the capital. I think it's pointing here, underneath the capital. But I'm perplexed as to the path to take down there. Well, the journey can wait, I suppose. I'll settle here for the time being, and start looking into it.",dialog
949,Merchant Kalé dialog27,Where...did you find this letter?,dialog
950,Merchant Kalé dialog28,"I can't imagine how it ended up there... But the well might just lead under the capital. To the spot indicated by the cryptogram from the letter. Seems like an odd place for the Great Caravan... But no amount of thinking will change anything. I'll be heading straight there, after some preparation. Once again, I find myself in your debt. Take this, as a token of my appreciation. It's not from my usual stock, but something rather more special. I hope you can join me at the Great Caravan, in fact. Who knows what wonders there might be to trade?",dialog
951,Merchant Kalé dialog29,"Ah, you, is it... Did you see? What they did to my ancestors? The whole clan, buried alive. Sick. Maddened. Husks of themselves. Have you heard their moans? They're hardly human anymore. They think we worship the Three Fingers? That we called the maddening sickness down upon them? Well. If that's what they expect from us, then that's what they shall get from us!  The world of grace and its people should have been content to see us sink between the cracks. But to have intruded upon our solace... Having broken us upon their whims... I'll never forgive any of you.",dialog
952,Merchant Kalé dialog30,"I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer. And...I think it's time we parted ways. Guided by grace, you seek to become Elden Lord. I don't want anything to do with you Tarnished lot any more.",dialog
953,Merchant Kalé dialog31,I should apologise to you. It's my fault that we stumbled into this mess. I'm sorry.,dialog
954,Merchant Kalé dialog32,"I'm sorry, but we won't be trading any longer. I think it's time we parted ways.",dialog
955,Merchant Kalé dialog33,"Wait, what's that? That burn... Your eyes... You've inherited the flame of frenzy! Oh, that's it... That's what I need... To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire. The yellow flame of chaos...",dialog
956,Merchant Kalé dialog34,"Oh, that's it... That's what I need... To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire. The yellow flame of chaos...",dialog
957,Merchant Kalé dialog35,"O Three Fingers, throw wide the door. Please, bestow unto me the yellow flame of chaos. A frenzied flame to melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire. May chaos take the world. May chaos take the world.",dialog
958,Merchant Kalé dialog36,"The frenzied flame...burned me... I was not... a suitable home. Unknown warrior... You, who reached the Three Fingers' abyss... Tell the one... Who will become Lord... Divest yourself of everything, and head to the door. Divest yourself of everything... And pray to the Lord... To melt away the curses, suffering, and despair. And the Order, entire.

Then he insulted Malenia, lost to her in battle, only to lick her boots rather than die like a man. Has he no shame, the big girl's blouse? And to think, he's the blood of Godfrey!

1898,Rya the Scout dialog3,"Hello. It's rather chilly here, isn't it? My mistress sent me off on an errand... But I was accosted by a ruffian, and now I'm in a bind. Could I ask you lend a hand, perhaps? That thug made off with a precious necklace. I need someone to retrieve it. I would be sure to provide ample reward. Only... He, too, is Tarnished. If you've any qualms confronting your own, I shall find another...",dialog
1899,Rya the Scout dialog4,"Ohh, thank you dearly. What a blessing that we've met like this. The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way... Please, I must have the necklace back.",dialog
1900,Rya the Scout dialog5,"Yes, I see. Most unfortunate, but I'll have to make do. I know that some Tarnished balk at the thought of harming their own. But if you should change your mind, do not hesitate to speak to me again.",dialog
1901,Rya the Scout dialog6,Have you had a change of heart?,dialog
1902,Rya the Scout dialog7,"The thug should be resting at an abandoned home down the way... Please, I must have the necklace back.",dialog
1903,Rya the Scout dialog8,"Oh, yes, that is my missing necklace. Thank you kindly. I am in your debt. Did I forget to announce myself? I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor. I seek stalwart Tarnished who might join our house. You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand, but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind. Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks. Please, take this. Brave Tarnished, seek the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree.",dialog
1904,Rya the Scout dialog9,"Most Tarnished are doomed to wander the outskirts of the Lands Between, peering wistfully at the towering Erdtree... But you are no ordinary Tarnished. And once that is proven, the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions.",dialog
1905,Rya the Scout dialog10,"Ohh, and... One more thing, only for you... This land of Liurnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the Grand Lift of Dectus, beyond the High Road. But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of passage. Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff. At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel. It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau. I have faith in you. A champion, through and through. I do hope that we can meet again.",dialog
1906,Rya the Scout dialog11,"I've been waiting for you. I knew you had the stuff of champions. I hereby invite you to the Volcano Manor. Take my hand, and have audience with my mistress. I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.",dialog
1907,Rya the Scout dialog12,I will pray. That you will follow the same path as Lady Tanith.,dialog
1908,Rya the Scout dialog13,Very well. Speak to me again once you are ready. You will find me here.,dialog

1910,Rya the Scout dialog15,Give me your hand. I will pray. That you follow the same path as Lady Tanith.,dialog
1911,Rya the Scout dialog16,"Hello... Hello... Right over here... But I hardly hold him in high regard. He seems to bear animosity toward the Volcano Manor. Perhaps it is to be expected, only... his intent, while vicious, is also tenuous, as if his heart is not in it. Doesn't really seem like champion material, to me...",dialog
1912,Rya the Scout dialog17,"Brave Tarnished, what is your business here? I'm afraid this is not a guest room. What's that peculiar look upon your face? <gasp> Goodness, am I still a serpent? Oh, how dreadful... How dreadful indeed... Forgive my distress. I ought to be thanking you for treating me as usual, despite this appearance. Brave Tarnished.",dialog
1913,Rya the Scout dialog18,"This is my true form. My real name is Zorayas. Please forgive the deception. Do understand. This duplicity is my own doing. Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems.",dialog
1914,Rya the Scout dialog19,"Lady Tanith is my mother. I am told I was born by the grace of a glorious king. That my mother cherishes this form I inhabit. I am proud of what I am. But people are cruel. If they saw my true form, they wouldn't speak to me. And so I assume a guise when seeking new recruits. But you are not like the rest.",dialog
1915,Rya the Scout dialog20,"My serpentine form, and the name Zorayas, were secrets known only to Lady Tanith and I. Now I share the secrets with you, as well. Please keep them safe from anyone else.",dialog

1917,Rya the Scout dialog22,"Hello again. Brave Tarnished. As a scout, I am pleased to see you again here at the Volcano Manor. Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.",dialog
1918,Rya the Scout dialog23,"Have you ever... heard any strange sounds here at the manor? Something beyond the walls, like breathing, or slithering scales... Oh fie, what am I saying? It just isn't possible. I must be tired.",dialog
1919,Rya the Scout dialog24,"Um, oh, it's you. Forgive me. My mind never ceases to churn of late. Hmm, well... I know I can trust you... I saw something, slithering in the pitch black of night. It entered the room across the hall, and never came out. If I'm not mistaken, it took the form of a serpent, just like me... Does the Volcano Manor hide some secret, that Lady Tanith has kept from me?",dialog
1920,Rya the Scout dialog25,"I realise that I shouldn't impose but, if you discover anything, would you please share? It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.",dialog
1921,Rya the Scout dialog26,"The serpent that lurked in the shadows that night... It entered the room across the hall, and never came out. Perhaps the manor yet holds some secrets. If you discover anything, would you please share? It entered the room next to this one, and never came out.",dialog
1922,Rya the Scout dialog27,"Really... Oh, so there was a secret after all... Oh my... Lady Tanith, my own mother, has deceived me... Was I not... born by the grace of a king?",dialog
1923,Rya the Scout dialog28,"Hello again. Brave Tarnished. It is a shame that I did not beckon you here with my own hand, but I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor. Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.",dialog
1924,Rya the Scout dialog29,"Hello again. Brave Tarnished. Do you remember me? I am Rya. We spoke once in Liurnia. I am pleased that we meet again, here at the Volcano Manor. Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.",dialog
1925,Rya the Scout dialog30,"A pleasure to meet you. Brave Tarnished. I am Rya, the scout. Very pleased to welcome you to the Volcano Manor. Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.",dialog
1926,Rya the Scout dialog31,"Brave Tarnished. Under Lady Tanith's guidance, may you tread the path of valour.",dialog
1927,Rya the Scout dialog32,"Sometimes I hear strange sounds beyond the walls. Like breathing, or slithering scales. Oh, perhaps I'm just feeling tired.",dialog
1928,Rya the Scout dialog33,"Hmm, what is this? I remember this scent, distinctly. ... Funny, isn't it. I am certain of it. I was born inside this. It's a part of my birth mother. You have my gratitude. Thanks to you, I am no longer afraid. I want to know. How I was born, and met Lady Tanith. One day, I hope to call her mother once again, this time from the bottom of my heart.",dialog

1931,Rya the Scout dialog36,"Oh, it's you... I'm afraid... there is something I must tell you. I was an unwanted child. Born not of grace, but of a hideous ritual. Something that can never be accepted, not by men, nor serpents. Even Lady Tanith shouldn't accept me. You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand, but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind. I know that you have done so much for me. But I wish to ask one last kindness. Kill me, please.",dialog
1932,Rya the Scout dialog37,I thought that I feared nothing. But this... Free me from this accursed frame.,dialog
1933,Rya the Scout dialog38,Agh... Thank you... My champion... Mother...,dialog

1939,Rya the Scout dialog44,"Oh, it's you. Heaven knows what happened here, but Lady Tanith, and all the Tarnished champions, are gone. It feels rather quiet without them. But with you here, things will be just fine.",dialog
1940,Rya the Scout dialog45,"I await Lady Tanith. I am her daughter, born by the grace of a great king. I do not wish to burden her, or cause concern. Brave Tarnished. Do tread the path of valour. I'm certain that this is what Lady Tanith wishes.",dialog
1941,Rya the Scout dialog46,"Please, stop, Brave Tarnished. You will only tire by striking this barrier.",dialog

If you find her, please be sure to tell me.",dialog
1947,Knight Diallos dialog2,"Be sure to tell me if you meet a young woman named Lanya. She's a servant to my house. She's been my companion since childhood. I've lost count of the number of times I've had to find her like this. Honestly, she's such a little tomboy.",dialog

1956,Knight Diallos dialog11,"I, um, I can tell... You're wondering about Lanya... Well, you see, I... After much internal debate, I've come to realise... Revenge is not the answer. According to Lady Tanith... I've got the stuff of champions. And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced to walk a tainted path. It hit me like a bolt from the blue... That my former thoughts were simple naiveté. Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya.",dialog

It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring. Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade. And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden. That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history. And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering. I once wished to become a scholar, you see.

The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite. Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time. I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets. Though only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death.

2273,Sorcerer Rogier dialog18,"Ahh, hello. I was hoping to see you. My examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks. Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives. Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Renalla. Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard. Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint. Truly, you have my thanks. But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you.

It is the familial home of the Carian royals from whom Ranni descends.

But I suspect she might have returned to the manor in which she was born...,dialog

Would you be willing to procure it for me? She may have returned to the manor that is her home. The Royal Carian residence to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.",dialog
2277,Sorcerer Rogier dialog22,"I'm afraid there's something I must tell you. Do you know of Those Who Live in Death? The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order. By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged. But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them. You may find this peculiar, but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives. These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order.",dialog
2278,Sorcerer Rogier dialog23,"Yes, indeed. If D knew what drives me now, he would surely boil over with rage. Or perhaps, he would even feel some pity. But no need to fret, none of that will come to pass. I can tell a good lie when I need to.",dialog

2307,Knight Bernahl dialog2,"Yes, you're a Tarnished through and through. Takes me back, but that's a quality needed now more than ever. Any interest in bearing the torch, of my battle arts? All I know is the sword. Picked up a fair few tricks in my time, too. Now's the time to pass 'em on. To a good and proper Tarnished, like you.",dialog

2310,Knight Bernahl dialog5,"There's a myriad of battle arts in these lands that I've yet to discover. Mementos of all the warriors who raised their arms in battle, lost, and died. A fine tale, all told, of true chivalric romance. That's how I fell in love with the sword, and the arts of combat. It grants meaning even to falling in battle, to death itself.",dialog

Even he was prepared to meet a wretched end when he first took blasphemy unto his very flesh. But anyroad, the Volcano Manor is no more. Though we may yet fulfil an old promise. We hunted our own kind, and took what was theirs. And with everything in hand, the time has come to rise, against the Erdtree.",dialog

You, on the other hand, have your own home, which is a far cry from here. So far, in fact, that it cannot be further marred by your touch. The Shattering caused a great many fools to overstep their bounds. Their impudence led to insurgency against Morgott, Lord of Grace. They raised an army, and sought to lay siege to this sacred ground. But do you see where it got them? King Morgott's rule would not be shaken!

Since Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her. And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth.",dialog

And when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower. Which is why... If you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters, I ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent. It must be done by your hand; no other. Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact.",dialog

You seem to have sown a seed in Millicent's heart. Which will flower most vividly, should she be plucked by you. Malenia will be a goddess. And once she is, Millicent will flower anew, as a scarlet valkyrie.",dialog

2545,Sage Gowry dialog29,"When the time is ripe... Do what you must to ensure Millicent dies. <sigh> Millicent, my daughter. Why would you take out the needle? You were so close. So very close.
