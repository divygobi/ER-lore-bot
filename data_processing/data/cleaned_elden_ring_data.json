Heh heh...ha ha...","type":"dialog"},{"name_en":"Patches dialog31","text":"Well, fancy meeting you here. Hold on, don't you say a word, my friend. I spoke no lie, not a one. You were trapped inside a volcano, no mistake, but the Erdtree was right outside. You just had to spring yourself out. I'm willing to admit. I could have been more clear. But I did not lie, and you're perfectly unscathed. All's well that ends well, right?","type":"dialog"},{"name_en":"Patches dialog32","text":"Oh, erm, hello, yes.

Despite my best intentions, I've done you wrong, I have. But here you are, standing tall and proud. All's well that ends well, eh. And my warning was spot-on, you tell me different!

Mm...heh heh...","type":"dialog"},{"name_en":"Patches dialog35","text":"You didn't listen last time, but I'm warning you again. Stay clear of Volcano Manor, end of discussion.

I always hated the gibberish about lost grace and the laughable Two Fingers. I thought I could lend a hand in unmasking the charade. Not to mention Tanith has always made me curious.

I've never seen a woman quite like her...","type":"dialog"},{"name_en":"Patches dialog44","text":"Hmph. Sharper than you seem, aren't you... I was just holding onto it for you, you know. Here you go. The reward for hunting Tragoth. All yours.","type":"dialog"},{"name_en":"Patches dialog45","text":"Now you've gone and killed Rykard? You scheming little bastard. You scheming little doxie. Cripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical... Perhaps a Tarnished will be Elden Lord after all... But for now, this Manor is finished. The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head. A fine mess, but how else could it end when daddy ambition is head over heels courting lady blasphemy. Heh heh...ha ha... Well, here I am.

Ohh, I had a bit of a slip-up, that's all. I should have stuck to what I know best... No matter. I know I-I can trust you. Gullible, yes, but a good soul. Make certain that Tanith gets this. Oh, it's nothing, it's just... Makes me sick to see her all bent out of shape. C'mon, Tanith, back on your high horse, where you belong.","type":"dialog"},{"name_en":"Patches dialog48","text":"You're able, then? Then I can rest easy, my friend...","type":"dialog"},{"name_en":"Patches dialog49","text":"Well, well, well? Thought you'd just help yourself to a man's personal belongings?

And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering. I once wished to become a scholar, you see.

The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite. Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time.

One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Renalla. Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard. Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint.

I beg you, kill Millicent. Before the girl can meet her sisters. There is no other way. It must be done by your hand alone. You seem to have sown a seed in Millicent's heart.
